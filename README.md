# e-commerce-meteora

# Getting Started:

This project was developed as a challenge by Alura's technology school, which provided the entire project design through Figma.

## Currently, this project is designed for screens up to 1440px wide. Note: it will be updated soon.

It was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 4. To simulate the database, I created a mock API using JSON.
### To initialize the project in your browser: 

## npm install 

you need to open: http://localhost:3000.

### Once http://localhost:3000 is open, use the command: json-server --watch db.json

Feel free to ask me anything.

All feedback is greatly appreciated!
